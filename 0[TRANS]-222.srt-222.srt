《神秘象咏》是那种难以忘怀的冒险之一。
Forspoken is one of those unforgettable adventures.


我知道数月后我依然不会忘记这款游戏，并且我想从现在开始。
I know it will be months before I forget this game, and I want to start now.


这是今年的另一个发布作品，几乎每一样东西都存在问题或是设计混乱，所以在12月份拼凑年度游戏提名名单时非常容易。
It's another of this year's releases that is making it very easy to put together the Game of the Year nominee list in December by virtue of nearly everything being broken or a poorly designed mess.


我要对Square Enix给予赞赏，他们摆脱了他们过去一直倚赖的玩家形象，而是选择了现实世界中真正的人类作为主角，
I'll give Square Enix credit for stepping out of their comfort zone of spiky-haired anime protagonists in favor of actual homo sapiens in the real world for once,


不过我又倾向于让他们回到过去，因为这显然是一个错误。
but then I'm inclined to push them right back into it because it was clearly a mistake.


Square Enix需要像对待一种激怒创造力的细菌那样将其隔离开来，远离西方游戏设计趋势。
Square Enix needs to be quarantined from Western game design trends like it's a virulent strain of creativity-killing bacteria.


他们试图按照他们认为在西方市场上流行的方式来打造一个故事，但它毫无灵魂，就像和自己的影子对话一样。
Their attempt at crafting a story in line with what they imagined was trending in the Western market is as soulless as having a conversation with your own reflection.

	
在当代的叙事中，最具威胁和可憎的力量往往是现代的诡计、父权制和资本主义。
In contemporary storytelling, the most menacing and abhorrent force is often modern-day skullduggery, patriarchy, and capitalism.



对一些人来说，在幻想世界中打败一个恶魔领主似乎比应对现实世界更容易。
For some, fighting a demon lord in a fantasy world seems easier to overcome than navigating the modern world.


如果这种情况让你感到困惑，那就准备好吧。
If this scenario leaves you scratching your head, buckle up.


是时候进入流行的日本文学题材的领域了，具体来说是“异世界”，相当于一次又一次加热同样的冷冻比萨饼。
It's time to dive into the realm of popular Japanese literary genres, specifically isekai, the literary equivalent of reheating the same frozen pizza over and over again.


异世界故事的关键是将一个现代的主角，通常是一个毫无希望、无方向感的灵魂，带入一个普通的幻想世界，在那里他们受到尊重，
Isekai is all about whisking a modern-day protagonist, typically a hopeless, directionless soul, to a generic fantasy world where they are given respect,


拯救世界，并获得一群仰慕者的女性，她们会因为他们失败的闹钟而爱上他那种超凡魅力。
save the world, and amass a harem of adoring women who fall for their alarm clock that failed to go off-level charisma.


忘记疗愈和自我成长，要变得更好，你只需要处在一个充满混乱和危险的世界中，再加上不会让周围每个人都疏远的神一般的力量。
Forget therapy and self-improvement, all you need to be your best self is a world filled with chaos and peril, plus godlike powers that somehow don't alienate everyone around you.
